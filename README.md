# Markov chain for detection DDOS attacks ‚õìÔ∏è
The main topic of this research is to investigate the potential of Markov chain models to predict and prevent DDoS attacks in 5G-based IoT networks. By analyzing past attack patterns and device behavior, these models can provide insight into potential vulnerabilities and enable proactive security measures.

## Tools ‚öô

- python

## Project implementation üïπÔ∏è
**A secure 5G-capable IoT architecture: an overview**
Figure 1 shows a hierarchical 5G-capable IoT security architecture based on distributed multi-access edge computing (MEC). This architecture uses three layers:
‚Ä¢ Access layer: It includes the physical devices that collect and transmit data to the MEC layer.
‚Ä¢ MEC layer: processes and analyzes the collected data.
‚Ä¢ Cloud layer: manages massive data.
